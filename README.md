# CI/CD Flask App Deployment with Docker, AWS, and GitHub Actions

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Flask web application using a modern CI/CD pipeline. The infrastructure leverages Docker for containerization, AWS ECS for container orchestration, and GitHub Actions for automation. This pipeline ensures efficient, scalable, and secure deployment for web apps.

## üéØ Features
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework.
- **Docker**: Containerized the application for consistent environment.
- **AWS ECS (Fargate)**: Scalable container orchestration with Amazon ECS.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation for building, testing, and deploying the app.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Uses IAM roles for secure AWS interactions and scaling through ECS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to package the app.
- **AWS ECS**: Elastic Container Service for deploying containers.
- **AWS ECR**: Elastic Container Registry for storing Docker images.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation.
- **Terraform** *(Optional)*: Infrastructure-as-code for AWS resources.
